binary search tree

-used a recursive approach, not necessarily better as each additional call to search1 will add additional overhead for saving
states of the algorithm during the run time.

-Method:
    - using low and high pointers, find a mid point.
    - if midpoint is the target return the midpoint index
    - if its less than target call search1 on left sub array(low to midpoint - 1)
    - else greater than target call search1 on right sub array(midpoint + 1 to high)
    - if at any time midpoint index is higher than high or lower than low return -1
