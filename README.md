# interview-prep
Used to commit files while I practice for interviews


This is meant to track my time as I explore Leet Code questions and document any and all work I go through.
Feel free to leave feedback, all code will be Python specific, but I will also leave notes named after the exercise I work on
in order to have supplemental notes to review while getting ready for interviews.

If you would like access to add/review/edit any files please leave me a messsage
Thanks
