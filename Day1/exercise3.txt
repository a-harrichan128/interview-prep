This exercise was a bit more complicated than previous. While still using a split methodology i decided to split the work 
in two. There were two conditions to check for before continuing, the first being
   if the target number was smaller than the first entry
   or
   if the target number was larger than the last entry
these condition immediately return the beginning or end of the array as locations respectively.

the next requirement was to limit the size of checking through the array sequentially in the event the array is larger than 10 items.
the condition on line 17 is meant to set the pointer left and right to a range not larger than 10 items. after which the following block will
check between both pointer sequentially until it finds either the target, or the first item larger than target and use this as the index
to insert.

the condition to break the while loop is to change the value of "left" pointer equal to right + 1 in order to stop the while loop.
The variable found is used to hold the index, if one is not found(which is impossible) it returns -1.
